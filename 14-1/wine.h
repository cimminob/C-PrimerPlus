/*
The Wine class has a string class object member(see Chapter 4) that holds the
name of a wine and a Pair object(as discussed in this chapter) of valarray<int>
objects(as discussed in this chapter).The first member of each Pair object holds
the vintage years, and the second member holds the numbers of bottles owned for
the corresponding particular vintage year.For example, the first valarray object of
the Pair object might hold the years 1988, 1992, and 1996, and the second
valarray object might hold the bottle counts 24, 48, and 144. It may be convenient
for Wine to have an int member that stores the number of years.Also some
typedefs might be useful to simplify the coding :

typedef std::valarray<int> ArrayInt;
typedef Pair<ArrayInt, ArrayInt> PairArray;

Thus, the PairArray type represents type Pair<std::valarray<int>,
std::valarray<int> >. Implement the Wine class by using containment.The class
should have a default constructor and at least the following constructors:
// initialize label to l, number of years to y,
// vintage years to yr[], bottles to bot[]
Wine(const char * l, int y, const int yr[], const int bot[]);
// initialize label to l, number of years to y,

// create array objects of length y
Wine(const char * l, int y);

The Wine class should have a method GetBottles() that, given a Wine object with
y years, prompts the user to enter the corresponding number of vintage years and
bottle counts.A method Label() should return a reference to the wine name.A
method sum() should return the total number of bottles in the second
valarray<int> object in the Pair object.
